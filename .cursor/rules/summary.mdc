FSMappoint

Environment:
- We use React
- We use Javascript & JSX
- In future we want to deploy it in AWS (amplify?)
- FSM Customers should be able to install the Extension by themselfes
- we also need a license management so we can maintain validFrom and ValidTo dates per Tenant that has installed this extension, to prevent them opening the extension if there is no valid license anymore.

Goal:
- Develop an SAP FSM Extension (Webapplication)
- The extension is used to send informations about Activities to a ServiceCall to a BusinessPartner contact with a link to a appointment bookings site
	+ This generates a instance where the fsm user aswell as the customer which recieved the link
	+ on this instance, there are informations about the servicecall, activity and potential start & enddates
	+ the customer can then select one of the appointment dateTime and approve it or request another date & time
	+ if the customer approves a valid appointment, the activity gets automatically planned and release to the planning board
	+ if the customer provided a new request with a new date and time, the fsm users can see this in the overview list and can either confirm or reject it
- In the FSM Web App the Extension is also available for the users in FSM
	+ in there they see all pending appointment instances with status (valid until, approved, request, rejected)
	+ they also see a list of all other unplanned activities which currently not have any appointment request open and can trigger it for on or multiple of them
